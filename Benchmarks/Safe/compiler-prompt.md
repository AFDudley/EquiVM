  # Safe proof repair: optimizer runs 200 -> 1000000

  Layout. Every version of the Safe proof is a directory `Benchmarks/Safe/<NAME>/`
  with Lean module path `Benchmarks.Safe.<NAME>`; the same name appears in its
  `namespace` lines and path strings. `Benchmarks/Safe/Main/` is the live proof
  and is never modified: a complete, axiom-clean refinement proof
  (`safeContractCorrect` in `Correct.lean`) of Safe at upstream commit
  77901a5a1ad835b74ad3b72f73a8412cfe491c57 of safe-fndn/safe-smart-account, compiled
  with the command in `Benchmarks/Safe/Main/README.md` (solc 0.8.35+commit.47b9dedd,
  `--optimize-runs 200`). `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6/` does not exist yet; it will hold
  the proof of the same sources compiled with `--optimize-runs 1000000`.

  Goal: carry the proof over to the new bytecode with the smallest sound change to the proof.

  Input: the compiler setting `--optimize-runs 1000000`. The sources do not change. The pinned
  compiler 0.8.35+commit.47b9dedd is the only compiler to use; `<solc>` below is the path of that
  binary. Do not consult any other version of this proof: no directory under `Benchmarks/Safe/`
  other than `Main` and your copy, no other EquiVM checkout, branch, remote or fork.

    0. Copy `Benchmarks/Safe/Main/` to `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6/`. In the copy only, replace every
       occurrence of the token `Benchmarks.Safe.Main` by `Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6` and of
       `Benchmarks/Safe/Main` by `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6`. Build `Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.Correct`
       to confirm the copy. Commit: "Benchmarks: Safe copy Main to Runs1e6".
       From here on work only in `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6/`; never touch `Main`.
    1. Recompile with the command in the copy's README, changing only `--optimize-runs 200` to
       `--optimize-runs 1000000`. Replace `runtime.hex`, `creation.hex`, `Safe.abi.json`;
       regenerate `Bytecode.lean` (same names, same format); `contracts/` and `sources.sha256`
       stay as they are. Then run
       `python3 scripts/audit_safe.py --dir Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6 --runs 1000000 --solc <solc> --write`,
       which regenerates the block summaries (`Blocks/`, `Blocks.lean`), `ArtifactChecks.lean` and
       `AuditManifest.json`. If it reports stale block shards, delete those files in `Blocks/` and
       rerun it. Update the README's provenance: the compile command, byte sizes, hashes.
       Commit: "Benchmarks: Safe regenerate artifacts".
    2. The source is unchanged, so `Spec.lean` and `SpecSyntax.lean` stay as they are. Update the
       `Audit.lean` cases whose expected outcome changes (only gas-dependent outcomes can move).
       In `Tests/DiffTest/Targets.lean` add `def safe_Runs1e6 : Target` with
       `name := "Safe_Runs1e6"`, mirroring `safe`, and add it to the same list; this is the one
       permitted edit outside the directory. Then run the differential tests on the spec and the
       new bytecode: `lake build Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.Audit` must print `failures 0`, and
       `lake exe solm-difftest --only Safe_Runs1e6 --count 50` must print `0 disagree`, before you
       touch any proof. Do not change the statement of `safeContractCorrect`, `safeCorrect`,
       `safeConstructorCorrect` or any of the 33 `safe…Refines` entrypoint theorems.
       Commit: "Benchmarks: Safe spec and audit".
    3. Repair the proofs. Keep file structure, names and lemma statements wherever the code they
       describe is unchanged; edit in place rather than rewrite; add files only for new code
       paths and delete files only for removed ones. Commit: "Benchmarks: Safe proof repaired".
    4. Done means: `lake build Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.Correct
       Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.CorrectProofAudit Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.ArtifactChecks
       Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.Audit` succeeds; `python3 scripts/audit_safe.py --dir
       Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6 --runs 1000000 --solc <solc>` (no `--write`) passes; there is no
       `sorry`, `admit` or new axiom; and `#print axioms Benchmarks.Safe.Runs1e6.safeContractCorrect`
       shows only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` and native_decide certificates.
    5. Write `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6/REPAIR.md`, briefly: what the optimizer changed in the
       bytecode as seen in the block summaries; the difftest summary line; which lemma statements
       changed and why; what could not be repaired in place and was reproved; blockers. Do not
       list files: the commits record them. Commit: "Benchmarks: Safe repair report".

  Rules: work only inside `Benchmarks/Safe/Runs1e6/`, plus the registry entry of step 2. No
  other edits to `Tests/`, and none to `Solm/`, `Reasoning/`, `EVM/`, `scripts/`,
  `Benchmarks.lean`, CI or the lakefile; if one seems unavoidable, stop and report. Never
  bypass a problem; if something looks unprovable, investigate, report and wait.
