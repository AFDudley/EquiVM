# Curve lending Vault proof scaffold

## 1. Compiler settings and provenance

Target: `curve_stablecoin/lending/Vault.vy` in Curve's `curve-stablecoin` commit
`f19a18abef6e75e3e08b1aa427ede724162bce57`. The pinned main source and its entire
15-file import closure are under [contracts](contracts/). Dependencies are:

- `curve-std`: `68a13eb2ee80bd704fc259a3aed0a6ce53d59b72`, pinned by the upstream `pyproject.toml`.
- `snekmate`: `0.1.2`, pinned by the upstream `uv.lock`; source archive SHA-256
  `8ed2c6a29b90424543d1792599c5c0b5ccf6988931b43029d1ca7e520a045038`.

[provenance](provenance/) preserves the upstream settings, dependency manifests,
lockfiles and main-project license. Source URLs are the pinned
[Vault source](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/f19a18abef6e75e3e08b1aa427ede724162bce57/curve_stablecoin/lending/Vault.vy),
[foundry.toml](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/f19a18abef6e75e3e08b1aa427ede724162bce57/foundry.toml),
[curve-std commit](https://github.com/curvefi/curve-std/tree/68a13eb2ee80bd704fc259a3aed0a6ce53d59b72),
and the [snekmate archive](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a4/f5/5b285024f0a18e699f2b144d9821b2572e8665331261c9078fdad6a7aa38/snekmate-0.1.2.tar.gz).

| Setting | Pinned value |
|---|---|
| Compiler | Vyper `0.4.3+commit.bff19ea2` |
| EVM fork | Cancun, from upstream `foundry.toml` |
| Optimization | `# pragma optimize codesize` |
| Nonreentrancy | `# pragma nonreentrancy on`; transient lock |
| Metadata | Compiler default, enabled |
| Runtime | 8,635 bytes, including 347 bytes of dispatcher tables |
| Creation | 8,717 bytes: 17-byte prefix, runtime payload, 65-byte metadata trailer |
| Immutables | None; immutable valuation is the empty store |

The upstream absolute macOS compiler and search paths are replaced with the local
Vyper executable and the pinned `contracts` directory. The upstream `solc = 0.8.26`
setting applies to Solidity, not this Vyper compilation.

The shared scaffold compiler forces `--no-bytecode-metadata`.
[compile_foundry.py](compile_foundry.py) runs that compiler adapter, then recompiles
with default metadata and regenerates the creation artifact, build settings and
hash manifest. It asserts identical runtime and verifies that the only creation
difference is the trailing 65 bytes. Both creation variants are retained in
`provenance`; the proof and differential target use the full default artifact.

SHA-256 of the decoded bytecode bytes:

```text
runtime   7f5c6c95df32b2c194d1a7cc2eacbc4fb2884edc9e64e8c82e3c11cf1d9d4893
creation  374b02cb44f10e1b17e58e3f09befd7e2fb3a5d787ddc0d90b7065ba001b3293
```

[sources.sha256](sources.sha256) pins the sources and compiler artifacts.
[artifact-check.log](artifact-check.log) contains six `ok` lines.

Commands below run from the repository root. Set `VAULT_VYPER` to a Vyper executable
whose `--version` prints the pinned version.

```sh
python3 -B Benchmarks/CurveVault/compile_foundry.py --vyper "$VAULT_VYPER"
python3 -B scripts/scaffold.py lean --dir Benchmarks/CurveVault --module Benchmarks.CurveVault --force
python3 -B Benchmarks/CurveVault/generate_blocks.py
python3 -B scripts/bytecode_report.py Benchmarks/CurveVault --output Benchmarks/CurveVault/Vault.report.md
python3 -B Benchmarks/CurveVault/generate_codesize.py
python3 -B Benchmarks/CurveVault/audit_blocks.py
python3 -B scripts/scaffold.py check --dir Benchmarks/CurveVault
lake build Benchmarks.CurveVault.Correct
```

`SpecSyntax.lean` is the audited, authored specification. Do not replace it with the
translator's initial draft. The standard proof generator was run with force before
the allowed ABI/storage edits to `Spec.lean`. Its Vyper transient-layout and
codesize-dispatch limitations are recorded in `skeleton-generation.log` and
`dispatch-generation.log`. The local generator uses the shared generator for the
prelude, function stubs, constructor and composition; it generates the proved
dispatcher from the pinned two-stage tables and preserves the audited `Spec.lean`.
No shared generator, Solm module, reasoning module or global test registry was edited.
`Vault.spec.json` is the unedited initial translation report: its 13 reported holes
are historical. Their replacements (interface address access, controller hooks,
admin percentage and optional token returns) are in the finished `SpecSyntax.lean`.

[generate_blocks.py](generate_blocks.py) uses the shared RD generator for the
executable regions: 626 runtime units in 31 shards, plus the single creation-prefix
unit. It keeps all 22 CALL/STATICCALL boundaries for the proving session. It excludes
dispatcher tables, the creation payload and metadata from instruction generation;
the generic whole-byte disassembler otherwise generates spurious BLOCKHASH summaries
for those data bytes. All artifact bytes and jump tables remain pinned unchanged.

## 2. Differential runs and coverage

The local runner registers only this target in a hidden Lake package, preserving the
repository's test registry. It invokes the repository CLI as
`lake exe solm-difftest --only Vault --count 50`, with seed **2026**.
It also supplies the working-directory paths needed by EVMLean's Python precompiles.
Its Python dependencies are pinned in [precompile-requirements.txt](precompile-requirements.txt).

```sh
uv venv Benchmarks/CurveVault/.difftest/.venv
uv pip install --no-cache --python Benchmarks/CurveVault/.difftest/.venv/bin/python3 -r Benchmarks/CurveVault/precompile-requirements.txt
python3 -B Benchmarks/CurveVault/run_difftest.py --only Vault --count 50
lake env lean --run Benchmarks/CurveVault/SuccessfulPaths.lean
lake env lean --run Benchmarks/CurveVault/BoundaryCases.lean
lake env lean --run Benchmarks/CurveVault/InitializeDiagnostic.lean
```

Final CLI result, after supplying the precompile dependencies:

```text
Vault: 2525 cases: 2525 agree (756 successful), 0 disagree, 0 stuck, 0 EVM out of gas, 0 spec out of fuel
```

The exact coverage line follows. The full output is [difftest.log](difftest.log).
`PointEval failed` diagnostics are expected for sampled calls to precompile 10 with
invalid, short input; the final run has no missing-file/import exceptions or panics.

```text
successful/cases: constructor 25/25, withdraw(uint256,address) 0/50, withdraw(uint256) 0/52, withdraw(uint256,address,address) 0/51, totalAssets() 1/53, name() 49/53, convertToAssets(uint256) 0/52, approve(address,uint256) 22/53, previewWithdraw(uint256) 0/51, totalSupply() 45/52, transferFrom(address,address,uint256) 3/51, collateral_token() 44/50, pricePerShare(bool) 9/52, pricePerShare() 17/52, amm() 45/51, decimals() 49/52, asset() 36/52, increaseAllowance(address,uint256) 24/53, maxDeposit(address) 3/52, previewRedeem(uint256) 2/52, deposit(uint256,address) 0/51, deposit(uint256) 0/51, balanceOf(address) 47/57, borrowed_token() 44/53, redeem(uint256,address) 0/55, redeem(uint256,address,address) 0/52, redeem(uint256) 0/58, set_max_supply(uint256) 0/50, mint(uint256,address) 0/51, mint(uint256) 0/51, symbol() 44/52, decreaseAllowance(address,uint256) 38/52, transfer(address,uint256) 9/51, lend_apr() 0/54, previewMint(uint256) 0/51, borrow_apr() 6/56, factory() 49/52, maxMint(address) 2/52, convertToShares(uint256) 0/51, maxWithdraw(address) 0/50, maxSupply() 47/53, maxRedeem(address) 0/51, allowance(address,address) 42/53, previewDeposit(uint256) 0/52, controller() 43/54, admin() 4/51, initialize(address,address,address,address) 7/52, stray 0/100
```

Random initial states seldom combine a funded owner, suitable precision/supply,
authorized caller and three consistent external contracts. This explains the zero
successful counts on several vault and administrative arms. They are covered by
[SuccessfulPaths.lean](SuccessfulPaths.lean), which independently exercises **all 46
selector variants successfully**, using fixed controller/token responses and funded
balances. Result: `Successful paths: 46/46, 0 failures`.

[BoundaryCases.lean](BoundaryCases.lean) covers 100 cases with zero failures:
malformed symbol offsets, lengths, truncation and padding; uint8 return validation;
empty/short/false/noncanonical/oversized token returns; codeless tokens; checked
arithmetic before later calls; raw controller words in outbound calldata; and both
string getters with corrupted headers. Four deliberately enormous getter cases
exhaust EVM gas, as required by the gas argument below. See
[boundary-cases.log](boundary-cases.log).

[InitializeDiagnostic.lean](InitializeDiagnostic.lean) checks canonical symbol lengths
0, 1, 15, 16, 17, 30, 31 and 32, plus dirty padding, against final string storage words.
All nine agree successfully; see [initialize-diagnostic.log](initialize-diagnostic.log).
The initial failures on payable creation and string padding were fixed, not excluded.

## 3. Semantic audit and bytecode-specific behavior

The audit covers **all 378 executable runtime basic blocks**, bytes 0–8287, and the
creation prefix. [block-audit.tsv](block-audit.tsv) maps every block to its specification
statements, ordered observable instructions and source references. The manually
reviewed statement map is in [audit_blocks.py](audit_blocks.py). This ledger uses
source IDs to distinguish imported helpers; the generic report sometimes labels
their line numbers as unrelated lines of the main source.

Creation bytes 0–16 only copy and return the runtime payload at offset 17. They accept
call value, ignore appended constructor arguments and perform no storage writes,
calls or logs. The spec therefore has an empty **payable** constructor. The copied
payload and metadata are data during creation. Runtime bytes 8288–8634 are dispatch
tables, not instructions reachable by any entry or internal jump. There is no
fallback/receive: short or unmatched selectors revert at 6768; common guard failures
revert at 8284. Revert payloads are intentionally outside the refinement relation.

The audit fixed or recorded these differences from a direct source translation:

1. `_total_assets` checks `available_balance + total_debt` at pcs 6862–6876 **before**
   calling `admin_fees` at 6902. `lend_apr` checks both numerator products at
   1240–1287 **before** its `_total_assets` call. Deposits and mints read maxSupply
   before the second checked sum. Hoisted calls/reads now follow that order.
2. Token transfer hooks are actual calls, with EXTCODESIZE guards before the void
   call. Token `transferFrom` skips zero amounts; otherwise it calls first, checks
   success, and accepts empty output only if the token has code **after** that call.
   Nonempty output must contain a canonical true bool. Extra return bytes are ignored.
3. `initialize` persists nonzero string padding, including for canonical token
   symbols of lengths 17–32. Let `n <= 32` be the decoded length and `W` the full
   32-byte returned data word, retaining dirty padding. The 64-byte data representations are:

   ```text
   name:   "Curve Vault for " || W || uint128_be(n)
   symbol: "cv" || W || W[18:32] || uint128_be(n)
   ```

   Their logical lengths are `16+n` and `2+n`. The compiler writes the header first,
   then exactly `ceil(length/32)` data words; untouched trailing slots remain intact.
   `EncodedSymbol`, value concatenation and the allowed storage adapter preserve these
   observable words. The spec models no allocation, memory address, pointer or copying.
4. Both public string getters have a three-word loop bound. Consequently `symbol()`
   accepts raw stored lengths up to **64**, despite its declared write capacity of 34.
   Headers in `[2^256-63, 2^256-32]` wrap the loop count to zero and return an empty
   string. Other oversized headers revert, except the top 31 values, which necessarily
   run out of gas. These cases are modeled without a storage-length precondition.
5. A controller word re-read after allowance/balance writes must remain a full word
   when encoded as a `transferFrom` argument. The spec retains `_controller` as a
   uint256 storage view and casts only its **call target** to address. Its token-call
   encoder preserves the complete argument word. This avoids relying on hash-slot
   noncollision or on canonical storage after a write/call. The ordinary external
   `controller()` return still uses the initial canonical-address precondition.
6. The translator omitted the constant `decimals()` getter; its return of uint8 18
   at pc 6426 is included. Duplicate imported event declarations were removed.

Storage and effect order were checked through every shared helper:

- `_mint`/`_burn`: balance read, checked arithmetic, balance write, **then** supply
  read/arithmetic/write, then Transfer event.
- `_transfer`: recipient checks (`this` then zero), sender debit/write, **then**
  recipient read/credit/write, then Transfer. Equal keys and slot aliases retain
  the bytecode behavior.
- `_approve`: nested mapping write followed by Approval. `transferFrom` spends
  allowance even for owner==caller; withdraw/redeem skip that step for owner==caller.
- `withdraw` reads controller after allowance update and before burning;
  `redeem` reads it after burning. Borrowed token is re-read after each transfer hook.
- `_convert_to_shares` reads precision then supply; `_convert_to_assets` reads supply
  only after checking its numerator. MAX_UINT256 is a sentinel that triggers fresh
  asset calls, including the second group of calls in `maxMint`.
- `_available_balance` calls balance then fees and saturates subtraction at zero.
  Shared ceil division checks its denominator before the zero-numerator branch.
  Allowance increase/decrease intentionally wrap, then clamp overflow/underflow.
- Event signatures, indexed topics, argument order, call targets/selectors/value,
  static permissions, caller/default arguments and `address(this)` match the report.
  There are no block-header reads, creation calls, selfdestructs or delegatecalls.

### Computed dispatcher and all selector entries

For the 32-bit selector `s`, bucket `b = s % 5`. Read its five-byte record at
`8288 + 5*b`, obtaining `magic`, `table` and `size`. The secondary index is
`((magic*s) >> 24) % size`. Each seven-byte record contains the selector, 16-bit
entry pc, and flags: `flags & 254` is minimum calldata size; `flags & 1` is nonpayable.
All records have that bit set. Pcs 0–72 select/check the record, 73–89 enforce entry
guards, and 90–98 jump to the entry. Table reconstruction is asserted by the local
generator and used by its proved dispatch lemmas.

| Bucket | Magic | Secondary table | Records |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 8600 | 8495 | 11 |
| 1 | 46 | 8460 | 5 |

## 4. Proof scaffold, storage and ABI configuration

`lake build Benchmarks.CurveVault.Correct` succeeds; see
[correct-build.log](correct-build.log). There are exactly **47 sorry sites**: the
46 generated function-body stubs and `Constructor.lean`. `Common.lean`,
`Dispatch.lean`, the specification and composition have no holes or added axioms.
The generator proves dispatch plumbing only; contract bodies remain for the proving
session. The per-function reach lemmas stop at shared pc **73** with the selected
record and selector on the stack; the body proof must handle its entry guard and
the pc 90 computed jump. The table above gives the actual function entry.
All 32 generated block-summary modules also build; see [blocks-build.log](blocks-build.log).

The runtime theorem is `runtimeRefinementWithWF storageWF noGasBound ...`.
`storageWF` requires the initial words in slots 0–4 to be below `2^160`.
It imposes no string-length, mapping-slot or transient-word restrictions, and no
condition on a callee's post-state. Direct address writers are only `initialize`
and write validated calldata/caller addresses. The controller storage write adapter
checks this already-established range; mapping writes retain all 256 bits.
Do not assume global preservation of canonical address slots under arbitrary mapping
aliases. The bodies preserve raw controller arguments where that distinction matters.

| Persistent slot | Declaration / representation |
|---|---|
| 0, 1 | borrowed token, collateral token; full-word address slots |
| 2, 3, 4 | AMM, controller, factory; controller retains a raw uint256 view internally |
| 5 | maxSupply, uint256 |
| 6; 7–8 | name length; inline data, capacity 64 bytes |
| 9; 10–11 | symbol length; inline data, capacity 34 bytes |
| 12 | allowance: `keccak(keccak(word(12) || owner) || spender)` |
| 13 | balanceOf: `keccak(word(13) || owner)` |
| 14, 15 | totalSupply, precision; uint256 |

Hash inputs use two full big-endian words, **slot before key**. There is no Solidity
packing or hashed byte-string allocation. `vyperBoundedStorage!` supplies capacities;
the narrow write adapter handles the observable string padding and header-first order.

Transient slot **0** is a full uint256 in its own storage space. State-changing
nonreentrant entries require lock!=1, write 1, execute the body, then write 0 on
success. View entries only check lock!=1. `initialize`, the five contract-address
getters and generated public getters are reentrant and do not access this lock.
Cancun supplies TLOAD/TSTORE. Static-mode violations occur at the same first write
as in the bytecode; invalid arguments are decoded before the write.

All 46 entry ABIs contain only static scalars; none has a bound-bearing dynamic
parameter. `externalABI.withMode .vyper` handles entry calldata and explicit scalar
decoding: insufficient words or dirty address/bool words revert; extra calldata is
accepted. All entries are nonpayable. No constructor parameters need decoding.

| External operation | Selector | Kind | Result / guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| decimals() | `313ce567` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, canonical uint8; initialize additionally requires <=18 |
| symbol() | `95d89b41` | STATICCALL | custom `decodeTokenSymbol`, bounded String[32] with retained raw word |
| admin() | `f851a440` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, canonical uint160 |
| rate() | `2c4e722e` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, uint256 |
| total_debt() | `31dc3ca8` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, uint256 |
| available_balance() | `092314da` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, uint256 |
| admin_fees() | `1b1800e3` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, uint256 |
| admin_percentage() | `1059fcbd` | STATICCALL | >=32 bytes, uint256 |
| on_borrowed_token_transfer_in(uint256) | `a4a87022` | CALL | EXTCODESIZE before call; success; ignore return bytes |
| on_borrowed_token_transfer_out(uint256) | `3f888681` | CALL | EXTCODESIZE before call; success; ignore return bytes |
| save_rate() | `69c6804e` | CALL | EXTCODESIZE before call; success; ignore return bytes |
| transferFrom(address,address,uint256) | `23b872dd` | CALL | raw argument-word encoding; optional canonical true bool result as described above |

Every call sends zero value. The return-value STATICCALLs have no EXTCODESIZE guard;
codeless accounts normally return empty bytes and then fail decoding. The only
explicit `abi.decode` site is the optional bool in `tkn_transfer_from`, at pcs
7629–7679; it uses Vyper scalar mode. The custom symbol decoder (pcs 400–475) considers
only the first 96 returned bytes, accepts unaligned/overlapping offsets when their
logical extent fits, requires length<=32, and does not require padded returndata.
Its retained 32-byte data word is zero-extended beyond the copied return bytes.
All named-return scalar decoders ignore trailing data, matching the fixed output size.

Expected difficult proofs are initializer padding/partial storage writes, malformed
string getters, external-call/reentrancy boundaries, and ordered mapping writes
followed by raw controller re-reads. Share helper lemmas for asset accounting,
conversions, optional token return decoding, and the lock protocol. The block ledger
specifies the order needed to avoid a storage-slot-noncollision axiom.

## 5. Gas bound

The selected bound is **`noGasBound`**, the loosest possible bound in this model.
Starting gas is a UInt256, hence at most `2^256-1`; all gas up to `2^24` is included.
No source computation reads gas. GAS occurs only immediately before CALL/STATICCALL;
the existing call relation witnesses the actual forwarded gas and callee result,
including EIP-150 behavior. The spec does not replace a gas-sensitive callee result
with a constant or assume call success.

The low-level details to discharge in the body proofs are:

- **Symbol return offsets (pcs 425–475).** Addition of the output base to the offset
  is checked for wrap. A wrapped later length/extent calculation could only evade
  the abstract bounds after loading a word near the end of the 256-bit address
  space. That MLOAD expands memory beyond `2^255` bytes before the extent test can
  matter. With `a` memory words, `C_mem(a)=3*a+floor(a^2/512)`; `a>=2^250` already
  costs at least `2^491`, exceeding every allowed UInt256 gas value. Such paths
  refine via outOfGas. Small invalid extents simply revert, as the custom decoder does.
- **Corrupted string getters (pcs 6437–6650).** Their loop count is
  `((length+63) mod 2^256) >> 5`, bounded by 3. Ordinary lengths 0..64 produce the
  standard encoding. Lengths `2^256-63` through `2^256-32` copy no header and return
  the encoding of an empty string; the spec explicitly includes these cheap successes.
  For `length=2^256-k`, `1<=k<=31`, the padding operation clears the low `k` bytes
  of the copied length word, making it `2^256-256^k`. The subsequent RETURN needs
  more than `2^255` bytes of memory, again costing at least `2^491` gas. Therefore
  the spec's rejection of those remaining headers cannot exclude a completed call.
  This was also checked with four focused OOG cases at ordinary gas budgets.
- **Other encoding/storage loops.** Initialization bounds the token symbol at 32,
  so the name/symbol lengths are at most 48/34 and all buffer extents are fixed and
  small. All other arguments/results/events are static scalars. There are no
  arbitrary-length source allocations or unbounded storage loops. Failure returndata
  is copied only to revert; exhaustion during that copy is already a refinement case.

No lower artificial gas ceiling is needed. The quantitative arguments above are
obligations for the body proofs, not additional axioms or restrictions on valid calls.
